# Summer_Project
This repository contains the final paper for the summer project that was conducted in my final semester of my business analytics master's program.

This project consisted of collecting data, via web scraping, regarding movie box office revenue and related factors which was analyzed to determine which of these related factors impact how long it takes a movie studio, or movie distribution company, to release a current theatrical film to streaming platforms and/or other home entertainment channels. The idea behind this project was to start with a ground up approach to this issue to show how a timing decision, of which there is not a prior standard for, can be determined using business analytics and economic theory.
